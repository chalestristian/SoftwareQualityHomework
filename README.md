# Hi There, welcome 👋.

## Before you see what is here, let me say a thing:

#### These small folders of code above randomly named with greek gods names are homework. It means that I'm learning, so, take it easy if you see any glitch. I would like to say that I will often come here to rewrite the code when I learn a better way to do it, but the time is scarce and I will be occupied working hard to write the new things better. 👍
**Tks, @chalestristian.**
